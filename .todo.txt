Version 1.x:
    - More DOCS. 
        Done. Add precision for sites which do have reliable 301. There are two
        types of 301 that I can think of:
            - 301 on folders only. /sites/ -> 301 /fake/ -> 404
            - 301 on everything that looks like a folder. /sites/ -> 301 /fake/ -> 301
            This is very common on Drupal installations because of some redirect
            plugin.
