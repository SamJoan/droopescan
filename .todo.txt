Version 1.x:

    - More DOCS. 
    - Make plugins.txt and stuff static.
    - Handle 301 sites
        Done. Add precision for sites which do have reliable 301. There are two
        types of 301 that I can think of:
            - 301 on folders only. /sites/ -> 301 /fake/ -> 404
            - 301 on everything that looks like a folder. /sites/ -> 301 /fake/ -> 301
            This is very common on Drupal installations because of some redirect
            plugin.
    - Ensure droopescan runs in kali.
        - Add better error for old requests library?
        - Increase --timeout-host
    - install.php

    - Accept relative paths to -U
    - Why is drupal 6.17 not detected as such?
    - Add /var/www/cms-forsest tests to release script, automate testing. Improve release script.
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt
    - Autospec tests. Especially in update_tests.py as API should be static.
